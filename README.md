# qewl

Qewl (pronounced: /kuÀêl/) is a GraphQL Application Framework.
It is inspired by Koa, and turns your GraphQL schema into a Koa-like application, with support for context, middleware, and many other features.

It is great for working with **remote schemas** and **schema stitching** and things like **authentication**.

Qewl is work in progress, and will be launched soon!
